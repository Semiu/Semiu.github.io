My primary responsibilities are making quality data readily available for machine learning (ML) modeling, building and deploying data pipelines and ML models into production.

I am a fifth year Ph.D./MS candidate of Software Engineering (with minor in Cybersecurity) in [North Dakota State University's Department of Computer Science](https://www.ndsu.edu/cs/). 

My MS Thesis, under the supervision of [Dr. Malik Muhammad](http://cs.ndsu.nodak.edu/~mmalik/#), [analyzed the top 100 GitHub's Java projects to investigate the presence of vulnerabilities](https://github.com/Semiu/java-codesecurity). I defended this thesis on June 29, 2022.

My Ph.D. dissertation, under the supervision of [Dr. Simone Ludwig](http://www.cs.ndsu.nodak.edu/~siludwig/contact.html), is exploring machine and deep learning models for automated detection of security vulnerabilities in Java program source code. 

I had previously done a Ph.D.-awarding research in information visualization, graduated in 2016, from [Universiti Utara Malaysia](http://www.uum.edu.my/).

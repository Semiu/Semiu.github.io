Welcome to my blog. 

I have chosen this space to write on all I do: technical and non-technical. In the technical space, I will be writing on Python, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, Software Security, and everything in between. 

The non-technical would be covering book review, travelogue, opinion essays, and general articles reflecting everything and anything that tickles my fancy.

The [About](https://semiu.github.io/about.html) page provides more details who I am and what I do. 

I would be providing a mailing list subscription soon if you wish to be kept in the loop of my writings.
